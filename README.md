# Master Thesis Submission

This is the Submission of my Master's Thesis. 

## Content

Find two notebooks:

(1) The Binary Classifier (BC)

(2) The Sentence Similarity Classifier (SSC)

representing both components of the model architecture. 

Furthermore, find excerpts of the data in the corresponding folder.

For further development of the SSC, a revised notebook is provided in the 'SSC_v1.1' directory. It can be used as a starting point for further development.
